# Theme System Documentation

## Overview
This application now includes a comprehensive theme system that allows users to switch between light, dark, and system themes.

## Features

### 🎨 Theme Options
- **Light Theme**: Clean, bright interface with high contrast
- **Dark Theme**: Dark interface that's easier on the eyes in low-light conditions  
- **System Theme**: Automatically follows the user's operating system preference

### 🔧 Implementation Details

#### Theme Context (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)
- Manages theme state across the application
- Persists user preference in localStorage
- Handles system theme detection and changes
- Applies theme classes to the document root

#### Theme Toggle Component (`src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
- User-friendly toggle interface with icons
- Shows current theme status
- Displays system preference when using "System" mode
- Smooth transitions between themes

#### CSS Variables (`src/app/globals.css`)
- Uses CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Supports both class-based and media query fallbacks
- Smooth transitions for theme changes
- Consistent color palette across themes

### 📍 Theme Toggle Locations
The theme toggle button has been added to:
- **Login Page**: Top-right corner
- **Home Page**: Top-right corner  
- **Admin Page**: In the header next to other controls
- **Dashboard Layout**: In the main header

### 🎯 Usage
Users can switch themes by:
1. Clicking the theme toggle button
2. Selecting from Light (☀️), Dark (🌙), or System (💻) options
3. The selection is automatically saved and persists across sessions

### 🔄 System Theme Detection
When "System" mode is selected:
- Automatically detects the user's OS theme preference
- Updates in real-time when system preference changes
- Shows a tooltip indicating the current system theme

### 💾 Persistence
- Theme preference is saved to localStorage
- Automatically loads saved preference on page refresh
- Falls back to system preference if no saved preference exists

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Architecture
```css
:root {
  /* Light theme variables */
  --background: #ffffff;
  --foreground: #1f2937;
  /* ... other variables */
}

.dark {
  /* Dark theme variables */
  --background: #0f172a;
  --foreground: #f8fafc;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

### React Context Pattern
```tsx
const { theme, setTheme, actualTheme } = useTheme();
```

### Smooth Transitions
All theme changes include smooth CSS transitions for a polished user experience.

## Benefits
- **Accessibility**: Better viewing experience in different lighting conditions
- **User Preference**: Respects system settings while allowing manual override
- **Professional**: Modern, polished interface that adapts to user needs
- **Performance**: Lightweight implementation using CSS variables
